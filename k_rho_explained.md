We have divided the timeline into three distinct intervals, each with its own values for k and $\rho$, to reflect changes in reporting behavior and data variability over time. 


Each interval likely corresponds to different phases of the epidemic—for example, shifts in testing availability, public awareness, or policy changes—that influence how many cases are reported 
($\rho$), and how consistent the reporting is (k). 

+ A higher $\rho$ indicates better case detection, while a lower $\rho$ suggests underreporting. 
+ Likewise, a lower k reflects greater variability in reported cases (e.g., due to weekend effects or reporting delays), whereas a higher k implies more regular and stable reporting. 

By allowing k and $\rho$ to vary across intervals, the model can more accurately capture the evolving nature of case detection and observation noise, leading to more reliable inference and better model fit.

+ $\rho$ may increase initially due to heightened awareness and expanded testing, as health systems respond to the surge. However, if the outbreak overwhelms testing capacity, $\rho$ 
might drop again due to underreporting or delayed confirmations.

+ k typically decreases during the early stages of a major outbreak. This reflects greater variability in case counts due to inconsistent reporting, batch updates, or irregular detection 
(e.g., superspreading events or delays). As systems stabilize and reporting becomes more regular, k may increase again. **This is INCONSISTENT with our model.**
